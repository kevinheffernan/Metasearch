NOTE TO DAVID AND JOHN:

1 - BING is currently down

2 - I've left all my entireweb code in tact. My hope is that it will
	come back online sometime in the near future. In the meantime, you
	will simply get a warning but it will not effect the results. Also,
	because the code is still is still there, LMS is out of three etc.
	
3 - If you're using query expansion, it needs to send quite a lot of 
	requests so if it doesn't load the first time, please try again
	e.g. If you query 'blah one two' for synonyms and spelling corrections
	this will need 6 requests for the expansion alongside 5 requests for
	Entireweb, Blekko, and Bing

I didn't make many changes to the code since Tuesday but
here they are:

1) Add a few more advanced search options to the display
	- Case Folding
	- Stop Word Removal
	
2) Added more stop words to produce better clustering results

3) Add user evaluations + t-test results
